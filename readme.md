# Fork of OCT_DDPM
This fork of the DDPM for OCT is intended to clarify the inner workings of the original.
I'll move the main logic to a notebook where I may add a bit more interrogation (maybe plotting images?)
and then I'll go back through the source code and comment it a bit for clarity.
I'll probably also add a dataloader that works for me.
